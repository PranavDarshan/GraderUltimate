A web browser might have one thread display images or text while another thread retrieves data from the network, for example. A word processor may have a thread for displaying graphics, another thread for responding to keystrokes from the user, and a third thread for performing spelling and grammar checking in the background. Applications can also be designed to leverage processing capabilities on multicore systems. Such applications can perform several CPU-intensive tasks in parallel across the multiple computing cores. In certain situations, a single application may be required to perform several similar tasks. For example, a web server accepts client requests for web pages, images, sound, and so forth. A busy web server may have several (perhaps thousands of) clients concurrently accessing it. If the web server ran as a traditional single-threaded process, it would be able to service only one client at a time, and a client might have to wait a very long time for its request to be serviced.

We cannot allow a user program to get stuck in an inﬁnite loop or to fail to call system services and never return control to the operating system. To accomplish this goal, we can use a timer .At i m e rc a nb es e tt oi n t e r r u p t the computer after a speciﬁed period. The period may be ﬁxed (for example, 1/60 second) or variable (for example, from 1 millisecond to 1 second). A variable timer is generally implemented by a ﬁxed-rate clock and a counter. The operating system sets the counter. Every time the clock ticks, the counter is decremented. When the counter reaches 0 , an interrupt occurs. For instance, a1 0 - b i tc o u n t e rw i t ha1 - m i l l i s e c o n dc l o c ka l l o w si n t e r r u p t sa ti n t e r v a l sf r o m 1m i l l i s e c o n dt o1 , 0 2 4m i l l i s e c o n d s ,i ns t e p so f1m i l l i s e c o n d . Before turning over control to the user, the operating system ensures that the timer is set to interrupt. If the timer interrupts, control transfers automatically to the operating system, which may treat the interrupt as a fatal error or may give the program more time. Clearly, instructions that modify the content of the timer are privileged. We can use the timer to prevent a user program from running too long. A simple technique is to initialize a counter with the amount of time that a program is allowed to run. A program with a 7-minute time limit, for example, would have its counter initialized to 420. Every second, the timer interrupts, and the counter is decremented by 1. As long as the counter is positive, control is returned to the user program. When the counter becomes negative, the operating system terminates the program for exceeding the assigned time limit. 1.6 Process Management A program does nothing unless its instructions are executed by a CPU.A program in execution, as mentioned, is a process. A time-shared user program such as a compiler is a process. A word-processing program being run by an individual user on a PCis a process. A system task, such as sending output to a printer, can also be a process (or at least part of one). For now, you can consider a process to be a job or a time-shared program, but later you will learn that the concept is more general.

The process will be given the name of the ﬁle as an input and will execute the appropriate instructions and system calls to obtain and display the desired information on the terminal.

When we need a particular piece of information, we ﬁrst check whether it is in the cache. If it is, we use the information directly from the cache. If it is not, we use the information from the source, putting a copy in the cache under the assumption that we will need it again soon. In addition, internal programmable registers, such as index registers, provide a high-speed cache for main memory. The programmer (or compiler) implements the register-allocation and register-replacement algorithms to decide which information to keep in registers and which to keep in main memory. Other caches are implemented totally in hardware. For instance, most systems have an instruction cache to hold the instructions expected to be executed next. Without this cache, the CPU would have to wait several cycles while an instruction was fetched from main memory. For similar reasons, most systems have one or more high-speed data caches in the memory hierarchy. We are not concerned with these hardware-only caches in this text, since they are outside the control of the operating system. Because caches have limited size, cache management is an important design problem. Careful selection of the cache size and of a replacement policy can result in greatly increased performance. Figure 1.11 compares storage performance in large workstations and small servers. Various replacement algorithms for software-controlled caches are discussed in Chapter 9. Main memory can be viewed as a fast cache for secondary storage, since data in secondary storage must be copied into main memory for use and data must be in main memory before being moved to secondary storage for safekeeping.

What problems do they solve?
What problems do they cause? If a cache can be made as large as the
device for which it is caching (for instance, a cache as large as a disk),
why not make it that large and eliminate the device?Answer:When awakened by the interrupt,
it could update its local state, which it uses to keep track of the number
of interrupts it has received thus far. It could then repeat this process of
continually setting timer interrupts and updating its local state when the
interrupts are actually raised.Context:51 28 Chapter 1 Introduction temporary basis. When we need a particular piece of information, we ﬁrst check whether it is in the cache. If it is, we use the information directly from the cache. If it is not, we use the information from the source, putting a copy in the cache under the assumption that we will need it again soon. In addition, internal programmable registers, such as index registers, provide a high-speed cache for main memory. The programmer (or compiler) implements the register-allocation and register-replacement algorithms to decide which information to keep in registers and which to keep in main memory. Other caches are implemented totally in hardware. For instance, most systems have an instruction cache to hold the instructions expected to be executed next. Without this cache, the CPU would have to wait several cycles while an instruction was fetched from main memory. For similar reasons, most systems have one or more high-speed data caches in the memory hierarchy. We are not concerned with these hardware-only caches in this text, since they are outside the control of the operating system. Because caches have limited size, cache management is an important design problem. Careful selection of the cache size and of a replacement policy can result in greatly increased performance. Figure 1.11 compares storage performance in large workstations and small servers. Various replacement algorithms for software-controlled caches are discussed in Chapter 9. Main memory can be viewed as a fast cache for secondary storage, since data in secondary storage must be copied into main memory for use and data must be in main memory before being moved to secondary storage for safekeeping. The ﬁle-system data, which resides permanently on secondary storage, may appear on several levels in the storage hierarchy.

These commands can be implemented in two general ways. In one approach, the command interpreter itself contains the code to execute the command. For example, a command to delete a ﬁle may cause the command interpreter to jump to a section of its code that sets up the parameters and makes the appropriate system call.

It typically is substantially removed from the actual system structure. The design of a useful and friendly user interface is therefore not a direct function of the operating system. In this book, we concentrate on the fundamental problems of providing adequate service to user programs. From the point of view of the operating system, we do not distinguish between user programs and system programs. 2.3 System Calls System calls provide an interface to the services made available by an operating system. These calls are generally available as routines written in C and C++, although certain low-level tasks (for example, tasks where hardware must be accessed directly) may have to be written using assembly-language instructions. Before we discuss how an operating system makes system calls available, let’s ﬁrst use an example to illustrate how system calls are used: writing a simple program to read data from one ﬁle and copy them to another ﬁle. The ﬁrst input that the program will need is the names of the two ﬁles: the input ﬁle and the output ﬁle. These names can be speciﬁed in many ways, depending on the operating-system design. One approach is for the program to ask the user for the names. In an interactive system, this approach will require a sequence of system calls, ﬁrst to write a prompting message on the screen and then to read from the keyboard the characters that deﬁne the two ﬁles. On mouse-based and icon-based systems, a menu of ﬁle names is usually displayed in a window. The user can then use the mouse to select the source name, and a window can be opened for the destination name to be speciﬁed. This sequence requires many I/Osystem calls. Once the two ﬁle names have been ob tained, the program must open the input ﬁle and create the output ﬁle. Each of these operations requires another system call. Possible error conditions for each operation can require additional system calls. When the program tries to open the input ﬁle, for example, it may ﬁnd that there is no ﬁle of that name or that the ﬁle is protected against access. In these cases, the program should print a message on the console (another sequence of system calls) and then terminate abnormally (another system call). If the input ﬁle exists, then we must create a new output ﬁle. We may ﬁnd that there is already an output ﬁle with the same name. This situation may cause the program to abort (a system call), or we may delete the existing ﬁle (another system call) and create a new one (yet another system call). Another option, in an interactive system, is to ask the user (via a sequence of system calls to output the prompting message and to read the response from the terminal) whether to replace the existing ﬁle or to abort the program. When both ﬁles are set up, we enter a loop that reads from the input ﬁle (a system call) and writes to the output ﬁle (another system call). Each read and write must return status information regarding various possible error conditions. On input, the program may ﬁnd that the end of the ﬁle has been reached or that there was a hardware failure in the read (such as a parity error). The write operation may encounter various errors, depending on the output device (for example, no more disk space).","<s>[INST]List five services provided by an operating system, and explain how each

A new process (if one exists in the ready queue) must be selected for execution. There is a choice, however, for situations 2 and 3. When scheduling takes place only under circumstances 1 and 4, we say that the scheduling scheme is nonpreemptive orcooperative .O t h e r w i s e , it is preemptive . Under nonpreemptive scheduling, once the CPU has been allocated to a process, the process keeps the CPU until it releases the CPU either by terminating or by switching to the waiting state. This scheduling method was used by Microsoft Windows 3.x. Windows 95 introduced preemptive scheduling, and all subsequent versions of Windows operating systems have used preemptive scheduling. The Mac OS X operating system for the Macintosh also uses preemptive scheduling; previous versions of the Macintosh operating system relied on cooperative scheduling. Cooperative scheduling is the only method that can be used on certain hardware platforms, because it does not require the special hardware (for example, a timer) needed for preemptive scheduling. Unfortunately, preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions when data are shared among several processes. Consider the case of two processes that share data. While one process is updating the data, it is preempted so that the second process can run. The second process then tries to read the data, which are in an inconsistent state. This issue was explored in detail in Chapter 5. Preemption also affects the design of the operating-system kernel. During the processing of a system call, the kernel may be busy with an activity on behalf of a process. Such activities may involve changing important kernel data (for instance, I/Oqueues).

This scheme ensures that the kernel structure is simple, since the kernel will not preempt a process while the kernel data structures are in an inconsistent state. Unfortunately, this kernel-execution model is a poor one for supporting real-time computing where tasks must complete execution within a given time frame. In Section 6.6, we explore scheduling demands of real-time systems. Because interrupts can, by de ﬁnition, occur at any time, and because they cannot always be ignored by the k ernel, the sections of code affected by interrupts must be guarded from simultaneous use. The operating system needs to accept interrupts at almost all times. Otherwise, input might be lost or output overwritten. So that these sections of code are not accessed concurrently by several processes, they disable interru pts at entry and reenable interrupts at exit. It is important to note that sections of code that disable interrupts do not occur very often and typically contain few instructions.","<s>[INST]What is the meaning of the term busy waiting? What other kinds of
waiting are there in an operating system? Can busy waiting be avoided
altogether? Explain your answer.Answer:Busy waiting means that a process is waiting for a condition to be satised
in a tight loop without relinquishing the processor. The system clock is also used for
scheduling purposes. For example, the time quantum for a process is
expressed as a number of clock ticks. At every clock interrupt, the scheduler determines if the time quantum for the currently running process
has expired. If clock interrupts were disabled, the scheduler could not
accurately assign time quanta. This effect can be minimized by disabling
clock interrupts for only very short periodsContext:PU Scheduling 2.When a process switches from the running state to the ready state (for example, when an interrupt occurs) 3.When a process switches from the waiting state to the ready state (for example, at completion of I/O) 4.When a process terminates For situations 1 and 4, there is no choice in terms of scheduling. A new process (if one exists in the ready queue) must be selected for execution. There is a choice, however, for situations 2 and 3. When scheduling takes place only under circumstances 1 and 4, we say that the scheduling scheme is nonpreemptive orcooperative .O t h e r w i s e , it is preemptive . Under nonpreemptive scheduling, once the CPU has been allocated to a process, the process keeps the CPU until it releases the CPU either by terminating or by switching to the waiting state. This scheduling method was used by Microsoft Windows 3.x. Windows 95 introduced preemptive scheduling, and all subsequent versions of Windows operating systems have used preemptive scheduling. The Mac OS X operating system for the Macintosh also uses preemptive scheduling; previous versions of the Macintosh operating system relied on cooperative scheduling. Cooperative scheduling is the only method that can be used on certain hardware platforms, because it does not require the special hardware (for example, a timer) needed for preemptive scheduling. Unfortunately, preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions when data are shared among several processes. Consider the case of two processes that share data. While one process is updating the data, it is preempted so that the second process can run. The second process then tries to read the data, which are in an inconsistent state. This issue was explored in detail in Chapter 5. Preemption also affects the design of the operating-system kernel. During the processing of a system call, the kernel may be busy with an activity on behalf of a process. Such activities may involve changing important kernel data (for instance, I/Oqueues).

Time sharing (ormultitasking )i sal o g i c a le x t e n s i o no f multiprogramming. In time-sharing systems, the CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them, but the switches occur so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running. Time sharing requires an interactive computer system, which provides direct communication between the user and the system. The user gives instructions to the operating system or to a program directly, using a input device such as a keyboard, mouse, touch pad, or touch screen, and waits for immediate results on an output device. Accordingly, the response time should be short—typically less than one second. At i m e - s h a r e do p e r a t i n gs y s t e ma l l o w sm a n yu s e r st os h a r et h ec o m p u t e r simultaneously. Since each action or command in a time-shared system tends to be short, only a little CPU time is needed for each user. As the system switches rapidly from one user to the next, each user is given the impression that the entire computer system is dedicated to his use, even though it is being shared among many users. At i m e - s h a r e do p e r a t i n gs y s t e mu s e s CPU scheduling and multiprogram- ming to provide each user with a small portion of a time-shared computer.

I/Omay be interactive; that is, output goes to a display for the user, and input comes from a user keyboard, mouse, or other device. Since interactive I/O typically runs at “people speeds, ”it may take a long time to complete. Input, for example, may be bounded by the user’s typing speed; seven characters per second is fast for people but incredibly slow for computers. Rather than let the CPU sit idle as this interactive input takes place, the operating system will rapidly switch the CPU to the program of some other user. Time sharing and multiprogramming require that several jobs be kept simultaneously in memory. If several jobs are ready to be brought into memory, and if there is not enough room for all of them, then the system must choose among them. Making this decision involves job scheduling ,w h i c hw ed i s c u s s in Chapter 6. When the operating system selects a job from the job pool, it loads that job into memory for execution. Having several programs in memory at the same time requires some form of memory management, which we cover in Chapters 8 and 9.

Direct-access ﬁles are of great use for immediate access to large amounts of information. Databases are often of this type. When a query concerning a particular subject arrives, we compute which block contains the answer and then read that block directly to provide the desired information.

In addition, internal programmable registers, such as index registers, provide a high-speed cache for main memory. The programmer (or compiler) implements the register-allocation and register-replacement algorithms to decide which information to keep in registers and which to keep in main memory.

Because caches have limited size, cache management is an important design problem. Careful selection of the cache size and of a replacement policy can result in greatly increased performance.

With local replacement, if one process starts thrashing, it cannot steal frames from another process and cause the latter to thrash as well. However, the problem is not entirely solved. If processes are thrashing, they will be in the queue for the paging device most of the time. The average service time for a page fault will increase because of the longer average queue for the paging device. Thus, the effective access time will increase even for a process that is not thrashing. To prevent thrashing, we must provide a process with as many frames as it needs. But how do we know how many frames it “needs ”?T h e r ea r es e v e r a l techniques. The working-set strategy (Section 9.6.2) starts by looking at how many frames a process is actually using. This approach deﬁnes the locality model of process execution. The locality model states that, as a process executes, it moves from locality to locality. A locality is a set of pages that are actively used together (Figure 9.19). A program is generally composed of several different localities, which may overlap. For example, when a function is called, it deﬁnes a new locality. In this locality, memory references are made to the instructions of the function call, its local variables, and a subset of the global variables. When we exit the function, the process leaves this locality, since the local variables and instructions of the function are no longer in active use. We may return to this locality later. Thus, we see that localities are deﬁned by the program structure and its data structures. The locality model states that all programs will exhibit this basic memory reference structure. Note that the locality model is the unstated principle behind the caching discussions so far in this book. If accesses to any types of data were random rather than patterned, caching would be useless. Suppose we allocate enough frames to a process to accommodate its current locality. It will fault for the pages in its locality until all these pages are in memory; then, it will not fault again until it changes localities. If we do not allocate enough frames to accommodate the size of the current locality, the process will thrash, since it cannot keep in memory all the pages that it is actively using. 9.6.2 Working-Set Model As mentioned, the working-set model is based on the assumption of locality. This model uses a parameter, /Delta1,t od e ﬁ n et h e working-set window .T h ei d e a is to examine the most recent /Delta1page references. The set of pages in the most recent /Delta1page references is the working set (Figure 9.20). If a page is in active use, it will be in the working set. If it is no longer being used, it will drop from the working set /Delta1time units after its last reference. Thus, the working set is an approximation of the program’s locality.

Thus, another measure is the time from the submission of a request until the ﬁrst response is produced. This measure, called response time, is the time it takes to start responding, not the time it takes to output the response. The turnaround time is generally limited by the speed of the output device. It is desirable to maximize CPU utilization and throughput and to minimize turnaround time, waiting time, and response time. In most cases, we optimize the average measure. However, under some circumstances, we prefer to optimize the minimum or maximum values rather than the average. For example, to guarantee that all users get good service, we may want to minimize the maximum response time. Investigators have suggested that, for interactive systems (such as desktop systems), it is more important to minimize the variance in the response time than to minimize the average response time. A system with reasonable and predictable response time may be considered more desirable than a system that is faster on the average but is highly variable. However, little work has been done on CPU-scheduling algorithms that minimize variance. As we discuss various CPU-scheduling algorithms in the following section, we illustrate their operation. An accurate illustration should involve many processes, each a sequence of several hundred CPU bursts and I/O bursts. For simplicity, though, we consider only one CPU burst (in milliseconds) per process in our examples. Our measure of comparison is the average waiting time.

When a process enters the ready queue, its PCB is linked onto the tail of the queue. When the CPU is free, it is allocated to the process at the head of the queue. The running process is then removed from the queue. The code for FCFS scheduling is simple to write and understand.

This program is in the form of read-only memory ( ROM ), because the RAM is in an unknown state at system startup. ROM is convenient because it needs no initialization and cannot easily be infected by a computer virus. The bootstrap program can perform a variety of tasks. Usually, one task is to run diagnostics to determine the state of the machine. If the diagnostics pass, the program can continue with the booting steps. It can also initialize all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers and the contents of main memory. Sooner or later, it starts the operating system.

The program stored in the boot block may be sophisticated enough to load the entire operating system into memory and begin its execution. More typically, it is simple code (as it ﬁts in a single disk block) and knows only the address on disk and length of the remainder of the bootstrap program.

A new process (if one exists in the ready queue) must be selected for execution. There is a choice, however, for situations 2 and 3. When scheduling takes place only under circumstances 1 and 4, we say that the scheduling scheme is nonpreemptive orcooperative .O t h e r w i s e , it is preemptive . Under nonpreemptive scheduling, once the CPU has been allocated to a process, the process keeps the CPU until it releases the CPU either by terminating or by switching to the waiting state. This scheduling method was used by Microsoft Windows 3.x. Windows 95 introduced preemptive scheduling, and all subsequent versions of Windows operating systems have used preemptive scheduling. The Mac OS X operating system for the Macintosh also uses preemptive scheduling; previous versions of the Macintosh operating system relied on cooperative scheduling. Cooperative scheduling is the only method that can be used on certain hardware platforms, because it does not require the special hardware (for example, a timer) needed for preemptive scheduling. Unfortunately, preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions when data are shared among several processes. Consider the case of two processes that share data. While one process is updating the data, it is preempted so that the second process can run. The second process then tries to read the data, which are in an inconsistent state. This issue was explored in detail in Chapter 5. Preemption also affects the design of the operating-system kernel. During the processing of a system call, the kernel may be busy with an activity on behalf of a process. Such activities may involve changing important kernel data (for instance, I/Oqueues). What happens if the process is preempted in the middle of these changes and the kernel (or the device driver) needs to read or modify the same structure? Chaos ensues.

This scheme ensures that the kernel structure is simple, since the kernel will not preempt a process while the kernel data structures are in an inconsistent state. Unfortunately, this kernel-execution model is a poor one for supporting real-time computing where tasks must complete execution within a given time frame. In Section 6.6, we explore scheduling demands of real-time systems. Because interrupts can, by de ﬁnition, occur at any time, and because they cannot always be ignored by the k ernel, the sections of code affected by interrupts must be guarded from simultaneous use. The operating system needs to accept interrupts at almost all times. Otherwise, input might be lost or output overwritten. So that these sections of code are not accessed concurrently by several processes, they disable interru pts at entry and reenable interrupts at exit. It is important to note that sections of code that disable interrupts do not occur very often and typically contain few instructions.","<s>[INST]What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?Answer:In preemptive scheduling, the CPU is allocated to the processes for a limited time whereas, in Non-preemptive scheduling, the CPU is allocated to the process till it terminates or switches to waiting for the state.

As a result, Linux’s history has been one of collaboration by many developers from all around the world, correspondi ng almost exclusively over the Internet. From an initial kernel that partially implemented a small subset of the UNIX system services, the Linux system has grown to include all of the functionality expected of a modern UNIX system. In its early days, Linux development revolved largely around the central operating-system kernel—the core, privileged executive that manages all system resources and interacts directly with the computer hardware. We need much more than this kernel, of course, to produce a full operating system. We thus need to make a distinction between the Linux kernel and ac o m p l e t eL i n u xs y s t e m .T h e Linux kernel is an original piece of software developed from scratch by the Linux community. The Linux system ,a sw e know it today, includes a multitude of components, some written from scratch, others borrowed from other developmen tp r o j e c t s ,a n ds t i l lo t h e r sc r e a t e di n collaboration with other teams. The basic Linux system is a standard environment for applications and user programming, but it does not enforce any standard means of managing the available functionality as a whole. As Linux has matured, a need has arisen for another layer of functionality on top of the Linux system. This need has been met by various Linux distributions. A Linux distribution includes all the standard components of the Linux system, plus a set of administrative tools to simplify the initial installation and subsequent upgrading of Linux and to manage installation and removal of other packages on the system. A modern distribution also typically includes tools for management of ﬁle systems, creation and management of user accounts, administration of networks, Web browsers, word processors, and so on. 18.1.1 The Linux Kernel The ﬁrst Linux kernel released to the public was version 0.01, dated May 14, 1991. It had no networking, ran only on 80386-compatible Intel processors and PChardware, and had extremely limited device-driver support. The virtual memory subsystem was also fairly basic and included no support for memory-mapped ﬁles; however, even this early incarnation supported shared pages with copy-on-write and protected address spaces. The only ﬁle system supported was the Minix ﬁle system, as the ﬁrst Linux kernels were cross-developed on a Minix platform. The next milestone, Linux 1.0, was released on March 14, 1994. This release culminated three years of rapid development of the Linux kernel. Perhaps the single biggest new feature was networking: 1.0 included support for UNIX ’s standard TCP/IP networking protocols, as well as a BSD-compatible socket interface for networking programming. Device-driver support was added for running IPover Ethernet or (via the PPPorSLIP protocols) over serial lines or modems. The 1.0 kernel also included a new, much enhanced ﬁle system without the limitations of the original Minix ﬁle system, and it supported a range of SCSI controllers for high-performance disk access. The developers extended the vir- tual memory subsystem to support paging to swap ﬁles and memory mapping","<s>[INST]Write about monolithic kernel?Answer:Apart from microkernel, Monolithic Kernel is another classification of Kernel.

It increases the size of the kernel, thus increasing the size of an operating system as well. This kernel provides CPU scheduling, memory management, file management, and other operating system functions through system calls. As both services are implemented under the same address space, this makes operating system execution faster.Context:The Linux System Early in its development, the Linux source code was made available free— both at no cost and with minimal distributional restrictions—on the Internet. As a result, Linux’s history has been one of collaboration by many developers from all around the world, correspondi ng almost exclusively over the Internet. From an initial kernel that partially implemented a small subset of the UNIX system services, the Linux system has grown to include all of the functionality expected of a modern UNIX system. In its early days, Linux development revolved largely around the central operating-system kernel—the core, privileged executive that manages all system resources and interacts directly with the computer hardware. We need much more than this kernel, of course, to produce a full operating system. We thus need to make a distinction between the Linux kernel and ac o m p l e t eL i n u xs y s t e m .T h e Linux kernel is an original piece of software developed from scratch by the Linux community. The Linux system ,a sw e know it today, includes a multitude of components, some written from scratch, others borrowed from other developmen tp r o j e c t s ,a n ds t i l lo t h e r sc r e a t e di n collaboration with other teams. The basic Linux system is a standard environment for applications and user programming, but it does not enforce any standard means of managing the available functionality as a whole. As Linux has matured, a need has arisen for another layer of functionality on top of the Linux system. This need has been met by various Linux distributions. A Linux distribution includes all the standard components of the Linux system, plus a set of administrative tools to simplify the initial installation and subsequent upgrading of Linux and to manage installation and removal of other packages on the system. A modern distribution also typically includes tools for management of ﬁle systems, creation and management of user accounts, administration of networks, Web browsers, word processors, and so on. 18.1.1 The Linux Kernel The ﬁrst Linux kernel released to the public was version 0.01, dated May 14, 1991. It had no networking, ran only on 80386-compatible Intel processors and PChardware, and had extremely limited device-driver support. The virtual memory subsystem was also fairly basic and included no support for memory-mapped ﬁles; however, even this early incarnation supported shared pages with copy-on-write and protected address spaces. The only ﬁle system supported was the Minix ﬁle system, as the ﬁrst Linux kernels were cross-developed on a Minix platform. The next milestone, Linux 1.0, was released on March 14, 1994. This release culminated three years of rapid development of the Linux kernel. Perhaps the single biggest new feature was networking: 1.0 included support for UNIX ’s standard TCP/IP networking protocols, as well as a BSD-compatible socket interface for networking programming. Device-driver support was added for running IPover Ethernet or (via the PPPorSLIP protocols) over serial lines or modems. The 1.0 kernel also included a new, much enhanced ﬁle system without the limitations of the original Minix ﬁle system, and it supported a range of SCSI controllers for high-performance disk access.

If a thread attempts to enter a critical section when another thread is currently active in that section (that is, owns the section), the calling thread is blocked until the owner thread exits. If multiple critical sections must be used, each critical section can be assigned a separate name, and a rule can specify that no more than one thread may be active in a critical section of the same name simultaneously. An advantage of using the critical-section compiler directive in Open MP is that it is generally considered easier to use than standard mutex locks. However, a disadvantage is that application developers must still identify possible race conditions and adequately protect shared data using the compiler directive. Additionally, because the critical-section compiler directive behaves much like a mutex lock, deadlock is still possible when two or more critical sections are identiﬁed. 5.10.3 Functional Programming Languages Most well-known programming languages—such as C, C++, Java, and C#— are known as imperative (orprocedural )l a n g u a g e s .I m p e r a t i v el a n g u a g e sa r e used for implementing algorithms that are state-based. In these languages, the ﬂow of the algorithm is crucial to its correct operation, and state is represented with variables and other data structures. Of course, program state is mutable, as variables may be assigned different values over time. With the current emphasis on concurrent and parallel programming for multicore systems, there has been greater focus on functional programming languages, which follow a programming paradigm much different from that offered by imperative languages. The fundamental difference between imperative and functional languages is that functional languages do not maintain state. That is, once a variable has been deﬁned and assigned a value, its value is immutable—it cannot change. Because functional languages disallow mutable state, they need not be concerned with issues such as race conditions and deadlocks. Essentially, most of the problems addressed in this chapter are nonexistent in functional languages. Several functional languages are pr esently in use, and we brieﬂy mention two of them here: Erlang and Scala. The Erlang language has gained signiﬁcant attention because of its support for concurrency and the ease with which it can be used to develop applications that run on parallel systems. Scala is a functional language that is also object-oriented. In fact, much of the syntax of Scala is similar to the popular object-oriented languages Java and C#.

In these languages, the ﬂow of the algorithm is crucial to its correct operation, and state is represented with variables and other data structures. Of course, program state is mutable, as variables may be assigned different values over time. With the current emphasis on concurrent and parallel programming for multicore systems, there has been greater focus on functional programming languages, which follow a programming paradigm much different from that offered by imperative languages. The fundamental difference between imperative and functional languages is that functional languages do not maintain state. That is, once a variable has been deﬁned and assigned a value, its value is immutable—it cannot change. Because functional languages disallow mutable state, they need not be concerned with issues such as race conditions and deadlocks. Essentially, most of the problems addressed in this chapter are nonexistent in functional languages. Several functional languages are pr esently in use, and we brieﬂy mention two of them here: Erlang and Scala. The Erlang language has gained signiﬁcant attention because of its support for concurrency and the ease with which it can be used to develop applications that run on parallel systems. Scala is a functional language that is also object-oriented. In fact, much of the syntax of Scala is similar to the popular object-oriented languages Java and C#.

The age is more precisely a measure of the page’s youthfulness, or how much activity the page has seen recently.

"Discuss three advantages of dynamic (shared) linkage of libraries
compared with static linkage. Describe two cases in which static linkage
is preferable.","The primary advantages of shared libraries are that they reduce
the memory and disk space used by a system, and they enhance
maintainability.
When shared libraries are being used by all running programs,
there is only one instance of each system library routine on disk, and
at most one instance in physical memory. When the library in question
is one used by many applications and programs, then the disk and
memory savings can be quite substantial. In addition, the startup time
for running new programs can be reduced, since many of the common
functions needed by that program are likely to be already loaded into
physical memory.
Maintainability is also a major advantage of dynamic linkage over
static. If all running programs use a shared library to access their
system library routines, then upgrading those routines, either to add
new functionality or to fix bugs, can be done simply by replacing that
shared library. There is no need to recompile or relink any applications;
any programs loaded after the upgrade is complete will automatically
pick up the new versions of the libraries.
There are other advantages too. A program that uses shared libraries
can often be adapted for specific purposes simply by replacing one or
more of its libraries, or even (if the system allows it, and most UNIXs
including Linux do) adding a new one at run time. For example, a
debugging library can be substituted for a normal one to trace a problem
in an application. Shared libraries also allow program binaries to be
linked against commercial, proprietary library code without actually
including any of that code in the program’s final executable file. This is
important because on most UNIX systems, many of the standard shared
libraries are proprietary, and licensing issues may prevent including
that code in executable files to be distributed to third parties.","The answer is valued 3/5 since there is only partial answer. Only one question is explained, advantages and disadvantages are not mentioned","##Question: Discuss three advantages of dynamic (shared) linkage of libraries

that code in executable files to be distributed to third parties. ##Output:The answer is valued 3/5 since there is only partial answer. Only one question is explained, advantages and disadvantages are not mentioned","<s>[INST]Discuss three advantages of dynamic (shared) linkage of libraries
compared with static linkage. Describe two cases in which static linkage
is preferable.Answer:The primary advantages of shared libraries are that they reduce
the memory and disk space used by a system, and they enhance
maintainability.
When shared libraries are being used by all running programs,
there is only one instance of each system library routine on disk, and
at most one instance in physical memory. When the library in question
is one used by many applications and programs, then the disk and
memory savings can be quite substantial. In addition, the startup time
for running new programs can be reduced, since many of the common
functions needed by that program are likely to be already loaded into
physical memory.
Maintainability is also a major advantage of dynamic linkage over
static. If all running programs use a shared library to access their
system library routines, then upgrading those routines, either to add
new functionality or to fix bugs, can be done simply by replacing that
shared library. There is no need to recompile or relink any applications;
any programs loaded after the upgrade is complete will automatically
pick up the new versions of the libraries.
There are other advantages too. A program that uses shared libraries
can often be adapted for specific purposes simply by replacing one or
more of its libraries, or even (if the system allows it, and most UNIXs
including Linux do) adding a new one at run time. For example, a
debugging library can be substituted for a normal one to trace a problem
in an application. Shared libraries also allow program binaries to be
linked against commercial, proprietary library code without actually
including any of that code in the program’s final executable file. This is

"Compare the use of networking sockets with the use of shared memory
as a mechanism for communicating data between processes on a single
computer. What are the advantages of each method? When might each
be preferred?","Using network sockets rather than shared memory for local communication has a number of advantages. The main advantage is that the
socket programming interface features a rich set of synchronization
features. A process can easily determine when new data has arrived on
a socket connection, how much data is present, and who sent it. Processes can block until new data arrives on a socket, or they can request
that a signal be delivered when data arrives. A socket also manages
separate connections. A process with a socket open for receive can
accept multiple connections to that socket and will be told when new
processes try to connect or when old processes drop their connections.
Shared memory offers none of these features. There is no way for a
process to determine whether another process has delivered or changed
data in shared memory other than by going to look at the contents
of that memory. It is impossible for a process to block and request a
wakeup when shared memory is delivered, and there is no standard
mechanism for other processes to establish a shared memory link to an
existing process.
However, shared memory has the advantage that it is very much
faster than socket communications in many cases. When data is sent
over a socket, it is typically copied from memory to memory multiple
times. Shared memory updates require no data copies: if one process
updates a data structure in shared memory, that update is immediately
visible to all other processes sharing that memory. Sending or receiving
data over a socket requires that a kernel system service call be made
to initiate the transfer, but shared memory communication can be
performed entirely in user mode with no transfer of control required. Socket communication is typically preferred when connection management is important or when there is a requirement to synchronize
the sender and receiver. For example, server processes will usually
establish a listening socket to which clients can connect when they want
to use that service. Once the socket is established, individual requests
are also sent using the socket, so that the server can easily determine
when a new request arrives and who it arrived from.
In some cases, however, shared memory is preferred. Shared
memory is often a better solution when either large amounts of data are
to be transferred or when two processes need random access to a large
common data set. In this case, however, the communicating processes
may still need an extra mechanism in addition to shared memory to
achieve synchronization between themselves. The X Window System, a
graphical display environment for UNIX, is a good example of this: most
graphic requests are sent over sockets, but shared memory is offered
as an additional transport in special cases where large bitmaps are to
be displayed on the screen. In this case, a request to display the bitmap
will still be sent over the socket, but the bulk data of the bitmap itself
will be sent via shared memory.",The answer is valued 5/5 since this is the right answer.,"##Question: Compare the use of networking sockets with the use of shared memory

Compaction is not always possible, however. If relocation is static and is done at assembly or load time, compaction cannot be done. It is possible only if relocation is dynamic and is done at execution time. If addresses are relocated dynamically, relocation r equires only moving the program and data and then changing the base register to reﬂect the new base address. When compaction is possible, we must determine its cost. The simplest compaction algorithm is to move all processes toward one end of memory; all holes move in the other direction, producing one large hole of available memory. This scheme can be expensive. Another possible solution to the external-fragmentation problem is to permit the logical address space of the processes to be noncontiguous, thus allowing a process to be allocated physical memory wherever such memory is available. Two complementary techniques achieve this solution: segmentation (Section 8.4) and paging (Section 8.5). These techniques can also be combined. Fragmentation is a general problem in computing that can occur wherever we must manage blocks of data. We discuss the topic further in the storage management chapters (Chapters 10 through and 12). 8.4 Segmentation As we’ve already seen, the user’s view of memory is not the same as the actual physical memory. This is equally true of the programmer’s view of memory. Indeed, dealing with memory in terms of its ph ysical properties is inconvenient to both the operating system and the programmer. What if the hardware could provide a memory mechanism that mapped the programmer’s view to the actual physical memory? The system would have more freedom to manage memory, while the programmer would have a more natural programming environment. Segmentation provides such a mechanism. 8.4.1 Basic Method Do programmers think of memory as a linear array of bytes, some containing instructions and others containing data? Most programmers would say “no.” Rather, they prefer to view memory as a collection of variable-sized segments, with no necessary ordering among the segments (Figure 8.7). When writing a program, a programmer thinks of it as a main program with a set of methods, procedures, or functions. It may also include various data structures: objects, arrays, stacks, variables, and so on. Each of these modules or data elements is referred to by name. The programmer talks about “the stack, ” “the math library, ”and “the main program ”without caring what addresses in memory these elements occupy. She is not concerned with whether the stack is stored before or after the Sqrt() function. Segments vary in length, and the length of each is intrinsically deﬁned by its purpose in the program. Elements within a segment are identiﬁed by their offset from the beginning of the segment: the ﬁrst statement of the program, the seventh stack frame entry in the stack, the ﬁfth instruction of the Sqrt() ,a n ds oo n .

Preemptive, priority-based scheduling algorithms are discussed in detail in Section 6.3.3, and Section 6.7 presen ts examples of the soft real-time scheduling features of the Linux, Windows, and Solaris operating systems. Each of these systems assigns real-time processes the highest scheduling priority. For example, Windows has 32 different priority levels. The highest levels—priority values 16 to 31—are reserved for real-time processes. Solaris and Linux have similar prioritization schemes. Note that providing a preemptive, priority-based scheduler only guaran- tees soft real-time functionality.

What is NFS ?,The Network File System (NFS) is probably the most prominent network service using RPC.

The Internet URL system also uses this approach. This naming scheme is neither location transparent nor location independent. The DFS is structured as a collection of isolated component units, each of which is an entire conventional ﬁle system. Component units remain isolated, although means are provided to refer to remote ﬁles. We do not consider this scheme any further here. The second approach was popularized by Sun’s network ﬁle system, NFS.NFS is found in many systems, including UNIX and Linux distributions. NFS provides a means to attach remote directories to local directories, thus giving the appearance of a coherent directory tree. Early NFS versions allowed only previously mounted remote directories to be accessed transparently. The advent of the automount feature allowed mounts to be done on demand based on a table of mount points and ﬁle-structure names. Components are integrated to support transparent sharing, but this integration is limited and is not uniform, because each machine may attach different remote directories to its tree. The resulting structure is versatile. We can achieve total integration of the component ﬁle systems by using the third approach. Here, a single global name structure spans all the ﬁles in the system. Ideally, the composed ﬁle-system structure is the same as the structure of a conventional ﬁle system. In practice, however, the many special ﬁles (for example, UNIX device ﬁles and machine-speciﬁc binary directories) make this goal difﬁcult to attain. To evaluate naming structures, we look at their administrative complexity. The most complex and most difﬁcult-to- maintain structure is the NFS structure. Because any remote directory can be attached anywhere onto the local directory tree, the resulting hierarchy can be highly unstructured. If a server be comes unavailable, some arbitrary set of directories on different machines becomes unavailable. In addition, a separate accreditation mechanism controls which machine is allowed to attach which directory to its tree. Thus, a user might be able to access a remote directory tree on one client but be denied access on another client. 17.9.1.3 Implementation Techniques Implementation of transparent naming requires a provision for the mapping of a ﬁle name to the associated location. To keep this mapping manageable, we must aggregate sets of ﬁles into component units and provide the mapping on a component-unit basis rather than on a single-ﬁle basis. This aggregation serves administrative purposes as well. UNIX -like systems use the hierarchical directory tree to provide name-to-location mapping and to aggregate ﬁles recursively into directories. To enhance the availability of the crucial mapping information, we can use replication, local caching, or both. As we noted, location independence means that the mapping changes over time. Hence, replicating the mapping makes a simple yet consistent update of this information impossible. To overcome this obstacle, we can introduce low-level, location-independent ﬁle identiﬁers .( O p e n AFSuses this approach.) Textual ﬁle names are mapped to lower-level ﬁle identiﬁers that indi cate to which component unit the ﬁle belongs. These identiﬁers are still location independent.

Thus, a user might be able to access a remote directory tree on one client but be denied access on another client. 17.9.1.3 Implementation Techniques Implementation of transparent naming requires a provision for the mapping of a ﬁle name to the associated location. To keep this mapping manageable, we must aggregate sets of ﬁles into component units and provide the mapping on a component-unit basis rather than on a single-ﬁle basis. This aggregation serves administrative purposes as well. UNIX -like systems use the hierarchical directory tree to provide name-to-location mapping and to aggregate ﬁles recursively into directories. To enhance the availability of the crucial mapping information, we can use replication, local caching, or both. As we noted, location independence means that the mapping changes over time. Hence, replicating the mapping makes a simple yet consistent update of this information impossible. To overcome this obstacle, we can introduce low-level, location-independent ﬁle identiﬁers .( O p e n AFSuses this approach.) Textual ﬁle names are mapped to lower-level ﬁle identiﬁers that indi cate to which component unit the ﬁle belongs. These identiﬁers are still location independent. They can be replicated and cached freely without being in validated by migration of component[/INST]The answer is valued 3/5 since it is not the complete answer.</s>"

Such systems have two or more processors in close communication, sharing the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and peripheral devices. Multiprocessor systems ﬁrst appeared prominently appeared in servers and have since migrated to desktop and laptop systems. Recently, multiple processors have appeared on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Multiprocessor systems have three main advantages: 1.Increased throughput .B yi n c r e a s i n gt h en u m b e ro fp r o c e s s o r s ,w ee x p e c t to get more work done in less time. The speed-up ratio with Nprocessors is not N,however; rather, it is less than N.When multiple processors cooperate on a task, a certain amount of overhead is incurred in keeping all the parts working correctly. This overhead, plus contention for shared resources, lowers the expected gain from additional processors. Similarly, Nprogrammers working closely together do not produce Ntimes the amount of work a single programmer would produce. 2.Economy of scale .M u l t i p r o c e s s o rs y s t e m sc a nc o s tl e s st h a ne q u i v a l e n t multiple single-processor systems, because they can share peripherals, mass storage, and power supplies. If several programs operate on the same set of data, it is cheaper to store those data on one disk and to have all the processors share them than to have many computers with local disks and many copies of the data. 3.Increased reliability . If functions can be distributed properly among several processors, then the failure of one processor will not halt the system, only slow it down. If we have ten processors and one fails, then each of the remaining nine processors can pick up a share of the work of the failed processor. Thus, the entire system runs only 10 percent slower, rather than failing altogether. Increased reliability of a computer system is crucial in many applications. The ability to continue providing service proportional to the level of surviving hardware is called graceful degradation .S o m es y s t e m sg ob e y o n dg r a c e f u l degradation and are called fault tolerant ,b e c a u s et h e yc a ns u f f e raf a i l u r eo f any single component and still continue operation.

The HPNonStop (formerly Tandem) system uses both hardware and software duplication to ensure continued operation despite faults. The system consists of multiple pairs of CPUs, working in lockstep. Both processors in the pair execute each instruction and compare the results. If the results differ, then one CPU of the pair is at fault, and both are halted. The process that was being executed is then moved to another pair of CPUs, and the instruction that failed",
